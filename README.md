SpongeAPI munchy crunchy delicious recipes

This is the repository for the collection of Sponge recipes. 

Code modules, fully functional that demonstrate working are placed here one directory per Project.  

Intent is that each project is a stand-alone "Plugin" that can be compiled via gradle/mvn and imported
into the IDE.
